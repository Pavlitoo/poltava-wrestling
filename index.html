                              <p>Wrestling is a martial art and combat sport that involves grappling with an opponent and striving to obtain a position of advantage through different throws or techniques, within a given ruleset. Wrestling involves different grappling-type techniques such as clinch fighting, throws and takedowns, joint locks, pins, and other grappling holds. Many different wrestling techniques have been incorporated into martial arts, combat sports, and military systems. Wrestling can either be genuine competition or athletic theater (see professional wrestling).</p>

                              <p>Freestyle wrestling is an old sport that started in the late 1800s catch-as-catch-can sport in Great Britain. Wrestlers had to make an opponent fall and onto the ground and hold on to their shoulders firmly. Contestants had to be strong enough to leverage opponents to the ground to win fights. Most fights ended up on the ground with wrestlers grappling, trying to outmaneuver one another and get the upper hand. In the 1880s, freestyle wrestling was popular, and tournaments were being held locally. The New York Athletic Club held the first professional wrestling tournament, and by the end of the 1880s, professional wrestlers were getting a payment of $1,000 per game. In 1896, freestyle wrestling was a part of wrestling but was not an official wrestling sport. Olympics accepted freestyle wrestling as a sport in 1904 but put restrictions on dangerous holds. Also, Olympic Games defined the weight limits from junior weight to heavyweights. Removal of dangerous hold was for the wrestlers' safety to ensure that no one has fatal injuries after a fight. The United World Wrestling (UWW) was the first governing body to create freestyle wrestling rules in 1921. Wrestlers were expected to follow the rules of the game to avoid penalization or disqualification from tournaments. All the freestyle wrestling rules were adopted by the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) as the rules for matches. Several changes in the rules have been made to accommodate the development of the sport. Games were especially long at the beginning of the 19th century, and some world last for hours. Timed matches were introduced in the middle of the 19th century, and wrestlers had to work hard to gain the upper hand before the time was over. In the 1960s, three judges were added to tournaments to score freestyle wrestling games. The addition ensured that players had a fair score for executing moves that brought opponents down. In 1996, FILA was the governing body for freestyle wrestling, and they made significant changes in wrestling matches. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) made changes to remove wrestling from the 2020 Olympics. Wrestlers made petitions to fans to sign a petition requesting the governing body to return wrestling to the Olympics. Over 2,000,000 signatures and International Olympic Committee (IOC) accepted to return wrestling into Olympics on probationary bases in 2020 and 2024 Olympics. There are still hopes that wrestling will be part of the Olympics in the future.</p>

                         <div class="blog-post-title">
                              <p class="text-rules">Several rules apply to wrestling games to ensure a fair game for all parties. Here is a list of some of them:</p>
                              <p class="text-rules"><b>Gender:</b> Both genders are allowed to participate in the games. However, only men participated in matches initially.</p>
                              <p class="text-rules"><b>Format:</b> Freestyle wrestling matches begin with an introduction of each player. Introductions include brief accomplishments of the wrestler at the beginning of the match. After introductions, wrestlers shake hands, and the referee inspects each player for any infractions. Wrestlers settle on their sides of the mats and wait for the start whistle. The match begins once the referee blows the whistle.</p>
                              <p class="text-rules"><b>Session:</b> Each round includes three two-minute-long sessions. Judges score wrestlers depending on their competences. Wrestlers who have a higher score by the second round win without moving to the third round. For example, if player one has three-point from the first round and player two has one point, they will proceed to the second round. If player one gets two points in round two and player two gets zero points, then player one is the match-winner.</p>
                              <p class="text-rules"><b>Scoring:</b> Wrestlers get points for being aggressive and taking risks to beat an opponent. Wrestlers can earn from 1-5 points depending on their activities. Also, a player can get penalties for breaking the rules or not wearing the appropriate attire. Wrestlers get five points for a grand takedown, which places the opponent in a dangerous. Four points are awarded to contestants who takedown an opponent in a grand manner without placing an opponent in a dangerous position. Three points are awarded for any takedown that doesn't expose the opponent. Two points are awarded for a simple takedown, and one point is for a reverse move from a defendant.</p>
                              <p class="text-rules"><b>Judges:</b> Freestyle wrestling matches have three judges who keep the score. Judges have an area to sit and watch matches unobstructed.</p>
                              <p class="text-rules"><b>Penalties:</b> Contestants can lose one or two points for infractions during a match. Wrestlers who take a timeout for injuries that don't show blood lose points. Handling an opponent brutally can also result in penalties.</p>
